				<p>Hey guys!!</p>

<p>On the first day of 2019, I shared a video on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1txbrDxS1EpyQLHGI7EAzA">YouTube channel</a> that I will be taking up and completing the Whole30 challenge. If you would like to watch it, you can check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wrYi0xA2ZE">here</a>.</p>

<iframe width="620" height="460" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6wrYi0xA2ZE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>And guess what, I have successfully completed it. <strong>Yayy!!</strong></p>

<p>Resolution 1 of 2019 - ‚úÖ</p>

<p>I did not go through the reintroduction phase, which is mainly to observe what food categories suit your body and what don‚Äôt. I have reintroduced some food items in small amounts already and I am doing fine.</p>

<p>So how did it go? Continue reading to find out.</p>

<h3 id="my-observations--">My observations -</h3>
<p>Many people observe huge changes in their energy levels, sleep, mood, skin, digestion. I didn‚Äôt notice any significant change in those areas but I did see <em>consistent energy levels</em>.</p>

<p>My <em>food habits</em> have really <em>improved</em>. Since I did not have a lot of snacking options, and I almost do not drink coffee, I <em>drank a lot of water</em> (around 3 liters every day) and it felt good. I made sure I am eating a <em>filling breakfast</em>. I was watching what and how much I eat (never happened before). I have almost given up unmindful munching. While on this challenge I <em>never felt greasy or bloated</em> (I felt this very frequently before this challenge).</p>

<p>Although weight-loss is not a motive of this challenge, it is worth mentioning that I did <em>lose a couple of kilos</em>.</p>

<h3 id="a-sample-of-what-i-ate-in-a-day--">A sample of ‚ÄòWhat I ate in a day‚Äô -</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/whole30-breakfast.jpg" alt="Breakfast" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Breakfast</em> - 2 eggs fried in a pinch of coconut oil and 1 chicken sausage and a small cup of 	orange juice</li>
  <li><em>Snack</em> - Banana sprinkled with cinnamon powder</li>
  <li><em>Lunch</em> - Roasted chicken slices with lettuce, fajitas, tomato, onions, lime juice and cilantro</li>
  <li><em>Snack</em> - 3 almonds and 3 cashews and some plantain chips</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/whole30-chicken.jpg" alt="Tandoori chicken.jpg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Dinner</em> - Home made tandoori chicken</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-deal-with-snack-and-sugar-cravings">How to deal with snack and sugar cravings?</h3>
<p>There are a lot of Whole30 compliant snack options out there. Some of my favorites are -</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apple and almond butter</li>
  <li>Banana with cinnamon powder</li>
  <li>Berries</li>
  <li>Dried mango slices</li>
  <li>Date and coconut balls with pistachios</li>
  <li>Guacamole</li>
  <li>Plantain chips</li>
  <li>Cucumber with salt</li>
  <li>Almonds and cashews</li>
  <li>Almond milk with banana
While snacking, just keep in mind to keep a watch how much you are eating. The best way to do it is to not eat from the source.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-went-as-planned">What went as planned?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><em>Eating fruit as a snack</em> - Fruits saved me from failing in this challenge. I ate fruits with 	almost every meal of the day. They kept me full and also helped me shoo away my sugar 			cravings.</li>
  <li><em>Eating Indian meals</em> - I love Indian food and I can eat it forever. I did not try too hard to 	 follow and cook Whole30 special recipes. I cooked Indian meals and I thoroughly enjoyed it.</li>
  <li><em>Keeping an eye on what I am eating</em> - I took a quick look at the ingredients list on the 		packaging while at the grocery store. If at a restaurant, I went through the ingredients in 	the menu or asked the server.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-did-not-go-as-expected">What did not go as expected?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><em>Planning ahead and meal prepping</em> - I sucked at it. I did it for the initial 3-4 days and then 	 it did not happen at all. I went with the flow and ate whatever I cooked.</li>
  <li><em>Eating outside</em> - I did not manage to save food from previous night‚Äôs dinner for lunch 			everyday. I ended up with no choice but to eat outside. Most lunch options in my office 		cafeteria or in the nearby lunch place are not Whole30 complaint. So I either ended up eating 	  fruits or sometimes I had to skip lunch (which is not recommended).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
  <li><em>This challenge is not as hard as it sounds</em> - You can do it. Try it for 15 days if you find 30 days too daunting for your first attempt.
  -* You can travel and still follow your eating rules* - We travelled to Houston, Texas on the 25th 	day of this challenge. I love barbecues and Texas is famous for them. I controlled my 	cravings (I did try a teeny-tiny bit of the bbq rib but that‚Äôs it) and continued to eat as per 	Whole30 food rules.</li>
  <li><em>We are in more control of our cravings than we think</em> - I am a <em>bigggg</em> sugar lover. I had strong 	   cravings during the first week. I walked along the dessert counters in WholeFoods telling the 	 cherry pies that I miss them. Eventually, I got over it. If someone at work got a huge box 	of donuts, I was able to say no without feeling sad about it. This holds for things like 		eating 2 servings of pulao and chicken because it is so yummy. Keep it for tomorrow. You will 	  get the chance to relish it once again.</li>
  <li><em>Only the first bite matters</em> - The crazy sugar cravings can be satisfied with one bite of a 		cheesecake. You do not need to eat the whole slice at one go.</li>
  <li><em>Your body will thank you for eating mindfully</em> - It feels great to wake up in the morning with 	  your stomach not feeling full from last night.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="will-i-do-it-again">Will I do it again?</h3>
<p><strong>Yes</strong>. I might not do it for 30 days at once, but I will surely do it for 15 days. It is a very easy way to cleanse your system, eat mindfully and feel great!</p>

<p>Have you tried the Whole30 challenge? Do you think you will try it? Let me know your comments below. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>Love, Priyanka</p>
