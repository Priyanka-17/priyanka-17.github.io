## I completed the Whole30 challenge and I feel great üíÅ

Hey guys!! On the first day of 2019, I shared a video on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1txbrDxS1EpyQLHGI7EAzA) that I will be taking up and completing the Whole30 challenge. If you would like to watch it, you can check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wrYi0xA2ZE).

And guess what, I have successfully completed it. Yayy!!
Resolution 1 of 2019 - ‚úÖ

I did not go through the reintroduction phase, which is mainly to observe what food categories suit your body and what don't. I have reintroduced some food items in small amounts already and I am doing fine.

So how did it go? Continue reading to find out.

### My observations -
Many people observe huge changes in their energy levels, sleep, mood, skin, digestion. I didn't notice any significant change in those areas but I did see consistent energy levels.

My food habits have really improved. Since I did not have a lot of snacking options, and I almost do not drink coffee, I drank a lot of water(around 3 litres every day) and it felt good. I made sure I am eating a filling breakfast. I was watching what and how much I eat(never happened before). I have almost given up unmindful munching. While on this challenge I never felt greasy or bloated(I felt this very frequently before this challenge).

Although weight-loss is not a motive of this challenge, it is worth mentioning that I did lose a couple of kilos.

### A sample of 'What I ate in a day' -

  - Breakfast - 2 eggs fried in a pinch of coconut oil and 1 chicken sausage and a small cup of 	orange juice
  - Snack - Banana sprinled with cinnamon powder
  - Lunch - Roasted chicken slices with lettuce, fajitas, tomato, onions, lime juice and cilantro
  - Snack - 3 almonds and 3 cashews and some plantain chips

  - Dinner - Home made tandoori chicken

### How to deal with snack and sugar cravings?
There are a lot of Whole30 compliant snack options out there. Some of my favourites are -
  - Apple and almond butter
  - Banana with cinnamon powder
  - Berries
  - Dried mango slices
  - Date and coconut balls with pistachios
  - Guacamole
  - Plantain chips
  - Cucumber with salt
  - Almonds and cashwes
  - Almond milk with banana
While snacking, just keep in mind to keep a watch how much you are eating. The best way to do it is to not eat from the source.

### What went as planned?
  - Eating fruit as a snack - Fruits saved me from failing in this challenge. I ate fruits with 	almost every meal of the day. They kept me full and also helped me shoo away my sugar 			cravings.
  - Eating Indian meals - I love Indian food and I can eat it forever. I did not try too hard to 	 follow and cook Whole30 special recipes. I cooked Indian meals and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
  - Keeping an eye on what I am eating - I took a quick look at the ingredients list on the 		packaging while at the grocery store. If at a restaurant, I went through the ingredients in 	the menu or asked the server.

### What did not go as expected?
  - Planning ahead and meal prepping - I sucked at it. I did it for the inital 3-4 days and then 	 it did not happen at all. I went with the flow and ate whatever I cooked.
  - Eating outside - I did not manage to save food from previous night's dinner for lunch 			everyday. I ended up with no choice but to eat outside. Most lunch options in my office 		cafeteria or in the nearby lunch place are not Whole30 complaint. So I either ended up eating 	  fruits or sometimes I had to skip lunch(which is not recommended).

### Takeaways
  - This challenge is not as hard as it sounds - You can do it. Start with Whole15 for your first 	  try.
  - You can travel and still eat follow your eating rules - We went to Houston, Texas on the 25th 	  day of this challenge. I love barbeques and Texas is famous for them. I controlled my 			cravings(I did try a teeny-tiny bit of the bbq rib but that's it) and continued to eat as per 	  Whole30 food rules.
  - We are in more control of our cravings than we think - I am a bigggg sugar lover. I had strong 	   cravings during the first week. I walked along the dessert counters in WholeFoods telling the 	 cherry pies that I miss them. Eventually, I got over it. If someone at work got a huge box 	of donuts, I was able to say no without feeling sad about it. This holds for things like 		eating 2 servings of pulao and chicken because it is so yummy. Keep it for tomorrow. You will 	  get the chance to relish it once again.
  - Only the first bite matters - The crazy sugar cravings can be satified with one bite of a 		cheesecake. You do not need to eat the whole slice at one go.
  - Your body will thank you for eating mindfully - It feels great to wake up in the morning with 	  your stomach not feeling full from last night.

### Will I do it again?
Yes. I might not do it for 30 days at once, but I will surely do it for 15 days. It is a very easy way to cleanse your system, eat mindfully and feel great!
