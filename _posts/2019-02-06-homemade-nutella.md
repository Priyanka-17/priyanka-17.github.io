Did you know that 100 grams of  palm oil consists of 45 grams of saturated fats whereas 100g grams of hazelnuts consists of only 4.5 grams of saturated fats? Why do you need to know this? Well, look at the picture below.

Take a look at the palm oil, hazelnuts ratio in the world's most popular hazelnut spread. Concerning, right?

But who doesn't love Nutella? It is sooooo yummy! Solution? Let's make it. Our way.

Here goes the recipe.
# Ingredients -
* Raw hazelnuts - 250 grams
* Coconut oil(or any vegetable oil) - 1 tablespoon
* Sweetened cocoa powder - 60 grams
* Jaggery sugar(or coconut sugar) - 5 tablespoons
* Salt - 1 pinch
* Vanilla essence - 1 tablespoon

# Steps -
* Spread raw hazelnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast for 12 minutes(or until skin is brown) at 350F. Alterbatively, you can toast it on medium flame in a flat pan. Let it cool.

* Hazelnut shells do not taste good, so remove them. An easy way to do so is shown below. Half-fill a container and shake vigorously. The shells come off easily. Alternatively, you can place the nuts in a dry cloth and rubs off the skins.

*  Grind the hazelnuts in a food processor at full speed until you get a nut butter like consistency. This should take around 5 minutes in a heavy duty food processor.

* Enjoy it with crepes, fruits or all by itself.

# Taste-test - the truth
This nutella does not taste exactly like a store bought Nutella, but it surely tastes great! The most important fact is that it contains no palm oil, no dairy and no preservatives.  If you do not want it dairy free, you can add melted milk chocolate. I haven't tried it, but I guess it is going to taste more authentic.

Do try this out and let me know how you like it.

Love,
