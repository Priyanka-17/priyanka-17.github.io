My first vlogging experience was when I went on a solo trip to Pondicherry on September 2016. I tried to capture clips at the beach with my voice in the background. I never shared those clips. I don't think I have those with me anymore.

Jump 1 year to July 2017. I decided to move to Seattle, Washington, United States with my husband. This was my first international travel and I decided to capture the entire experience as a video log. I did click a couple of clips but never ended up compiling them. I do have those clips with me. I should make a video. That's for another day.

Next, August 2017. It had been around 1 month that I had moved to Seattle. I was waiting for my EAD (work permit) and hence spending most of my time at home. Vlogger streak strikes back!

I created my first video when we got a tent for our camping trip. I used iMovie to edit it. I posted it on Instagram. Check it out [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYK6bueDYeN/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet). This was the first video I ever edited and I believe I did a good job.

I decided to take this seriously and created my YouTube channel - ***Priyanka Vlogs*** which I later changed to ***Dhonni Meye***. Check out my YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1txbrDxS1EpyQLHGI7EAzA). Please subscribe to my channel if you enjoy my videos.

My first video on YouTube was about a friend's wedding. You will not see since I had to remove it for my friend's personal reasons. [Here are the rest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1txbrDxS1EpyQLHGI7EAzA/videos). I started as a personal vlog, travel and cooking channel. But I like to explore and I upload other content like comedy, lifestyle.

So well.. that's how it all began.
