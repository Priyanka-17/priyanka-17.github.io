Hey y'all! Howdy?

Last month I visited the largest city in the second largest state  of the fourth largest country in the fifth largest planet in the Solar System. I visited Houston.

The 2 things that come to my mind when I think of Houston are barbecue and NASA. We had 2 days. We knew how it was going to be. 

After [check in](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/houdw-aloft-houston-downtown/?scid=bb1a189a-fec3-4d19-a255-54ba596febe2), we headed for dinner to an Oaxacan restaurant, [Xochi](https://www.xochihouston.com/). It is a very well-rated restaurant in Downtown Houston and we weren't disappointed. I was on the [Whole30 diet](http://dhonnimeye.com/whole30-experience) at that time, so I had to be careful about what I was eating. I chose to have the Cochito Istme√±o(leftmost in the picture below) and it was really good.

After an amazing dinner, we went to a nearby [park](https://www.discoverygreen.com/) for a walk. There was an outdoor ice-rink and a chariot offering rides to people. You must be wondering didn't the ice melt? Well, no. Apart from their own mechanisms, Houston was pretty cold in January. I thought that Houston was warm throughout the year. Not true.

We chose to walk back to our hotel, umm... I would suggest on not doing that since the roads were very empty.

Next morning, we started early. We had a delicious breakfast of eggs and farm-style potatoes at [Table 7 Bistro](http://www.table7bistro.com/).

The good food got us energized for our day at the [Space Center Houston](https://spacecenter.org/). It was a 40 minute ride from Downtown Houston. We got our tickets [online](https://tickets.spacecenter.org/webstore/shop/viewItems.aspx?cg=SCHGACG2017&c=SCHGAC2017). I recommend you to do the same, especially if you are visiting during a weekend.

We took a train ride to NASA, spent time knowing about astronauts' time in space, various missions to space and the moon, seeing rockets. *I am reliving the excitement as I write.*  We saw the Saturn V rocket - the replica of the rocket that took man to the moon. It was a super fun experience.

Sadly, we missed the other train ride that takes you to the Mission Control room. I would recommend on doing the train rides first. We had a wonderful opportunity to attend a Q&A session by astronaut [Tom Jones](https://astronauttomjones.com/). He was part of four space shuttle missions. It was inspiring to hear from him.

The trip ended with some food from the huge cafeteria. The Space Center is a **must visit** for people of all ages.

For dinner, it was time for barbecue. We chose [Pappas Bar-B-Q](https://pappasbbq.com/location/downtown-pierce-st). The food was delicious. The quantity was huge.

Next day was our last day in Houston. After walking in Downtown for a while, we stumbled upon this place called [Bombay Pizza Co.](http://www.bombaypizzaco.com/). They serve pizza with Indian toppings. I tried the tandoori chicken. It was spicy, but tasty.

Right across Bombay Pizza Co. is this extremely affordable place called [Main Street Market](https://main-street-market-houston.business.site/). This is a place where you buy things that you don't need but you want to buy. In fact, you can even buy things that you need too. It sells almost every item you can think of. Half of the store was on sale and items were available for 1.29 bucks. I got 1 box of markers, a cap, 4 books including a hardcover cookbook, all for 12 dollars. I absolutely loved this store. I wish I had free checked-in luggage!

Before heading to the airport, we spent some time in the Houston sun. We went back to Discovery Park. It was beautifully decorated and filled with people and food trucks.

I enjoyed my time in Houston. Hope you enjoyed reading my experience.
