I love to travel, but my biggest concern with travelling used to be **packing**. The thoughts of *What if I forget this? What if I need that?* made me crazy. Over time, I have come to a realization - **money**(preferably in the form of card), **passport** and **phone** are the **MUST HAVES** during a trip. Rest, you can *beg, borrow or steal*! Just kidding, what did you take the money for?

I travel light. I don't remember the last time I had a carry on. Leave alone a checked bag. **Backpack** - my ultimate friend. I only carry essentials. You will find below, the packing checklist I follow. Carrying some items like umbrella, swimwear, jacket depend on the location and weather conditions. Otherwise, this is it.
