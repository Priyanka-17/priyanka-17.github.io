We spent an amazing Christmas vacation at Cancun, Mexico. [Here is a short clip of our trip](https://youtu.be/UrmSwPDCucI).

Enjoyed it? Awesome!! Let's go ahead and talk about a few things we did right and a few things we wish we had known before our trip.

The Mexicans speak Spanish. Learn a few Spanish words. The announcement for our flight in Seattle was in Spanish, Customs Officer in point of entry at Mexico spoke to us in Spanish, all airport members in Mexico spoke Spanish. You'll feel comfortable if you follow some of it.

Do not lose the tourist card provided to you at the port of entry in Mexico. You will need it while exiting Mexico. I almost dumped mine, but luckily found it in my bag pocket.

If you are not driving to and from the airport, do not rent a cab from the airport. Either call your hotel for a pickup service or pre-book shuttles. We used [Happy Shuttle](https://happyshuttlecancun.com/). It is the most efficient means of transporation for a trip to/from the airport. Cost 12 USD per person. The driver was friendly and the ride was comfortable.

If you are paying by cash, use Mexican Pesos. Most shops accept US Dollars. But the exchange rate is poor. We were paying in dollars first and we lost a fair bit in the exchange. A cab ride that costs 450 Mexican Pesos(23 USD according to current exchange rate) cost us 30 USD. Later, we exchanged dollars at our hotel and we got a decent rate.

Spend a few extra bucks and get access to unlimited food, drinks, free room-service and some hotel coupons by staying in an all-inclusive hotel on the beach. Before booking the hotel, check the number of restaurants it has. The more, the merrier. We stayed at [Secrets the Vine, Cancun](http://www.secretsresorts.com/en_us/resorts/mexico/vine-cancun.html). It had 6 restuarants and 3 bars. The staff was very friendly and service was amazing.

Even though it is an all-inclusive resort, tips are not included. Although it is not mandatory, tip the room service lady,the server, the bartender, the bellboy. Tipping a dollar for a drink or two, a dollar after a meal is good enough.

For your day trips to Chichen Itza or Tulum, you will find good deals on websites like [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com), [Expedia](https://www.expedia.com/). Avoid booking it from the hotel concierge as they are generally more expensive. We booked [Day trip to Chichen Itza](https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g150805-d12005530-Full_Day_Guided_Tour_of_Chichen_Itza_Mayan_Archaeological_Site_and_Cenote_Swimming.html) for 49 USD per person. The hotel was charging 117 USD per person for the same trip.

Tourists have a concern about travelling to Mexico. However, Cancun felt very safe. You can always check [Mexico travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/mexico-travel-advisory.html).
