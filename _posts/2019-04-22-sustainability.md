Happy Earth Day people!

Change is difficult. But you know what? A small change every day can make a lot of difference. If you follow a few steps towards sustainable living starting today, it will eventually make a huge impact in preventing our planet from deteriorating so fast.

I will share a few easy steps with you today which will help you to begin a sustainable lifestyle without trying too hard. 
* **Always carry a reusable bag** - Wherever you are going, carry a reusable bag. Put it in your backpack, pocket or carry it by itself. I have a white cloth bag which I have been using since 2014. I carry it with me almost all the time. It comes in handy if I go grocery shopping after work (happens very frequently) or choose to buy takeout for dinner. When I am travelling, I always make sure to carry an extra bag with me.

* **Avoid plastic bags whenever possible** - I know there are times when you absolutely cannot do without a plastic bag. There are times when you can do without one too. Make the right decision and choose not to use a plastic bag during such scenarios.
* **Carry your own coffee mug** - If you are someone who buys coffee very frequently or even once  a day, carry a reusable mug to the coffee shop. It is a great substitute for the paper cup and plastic lid you use each time. Also, many coffee shops give you a discount when you bring your own coffee mug.
* **Ditch the straw** - We have all seen the posts about straws (and other plastic items) clogging the ocean and hurting marine life. A very easy step towards reducing this is saying NO to the straw in your cold coffee or cocktail. If you really love drinking from a straw or for situations when you absolutely can't avoid it (drinking coconut water from a coconut), carry your own. A wide variety of reusable glass or stainless steel straws are available in the market. The same applies for cutlery while ordering takeout. Use the ones you have at home. Buy once, use many times.

* **Use what you already have** - I have read in a couple of places - "Stop using plastic containers, switch to glass containers!". What about the ones which I currently have and are working perfectly fine? Use them. Stop buying new ones maybe, but don't throw away the ones you currently own (unless it is for health reasons and that is a completely different conversation).
* **Segregate waste** - I know composting is a real pain and since we are discussing baby steps, let's just talk about recycle and trash. All recyclable items will have the recycle symbol on their bodies. Clean and throw it in the recycle bin. Toss everything else in the trash.

Things always come up and you don't have a chance or the option to keep all of these in mind. But even if you do this 7 out of 10 times, don't you think it will make a difference? Now imagine everyone doing it... sounds good, right?

Comment below and share your tips and tricks for a sustainable lifestyle. Letâ€™s heal the world and make it a better place.
